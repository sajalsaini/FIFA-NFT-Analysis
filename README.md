# FIFA-NFT-Analysis âš½
This [dashboard](https://app.flipsidecrypto.com/dashboard/fifa-nft-analysis-g5Lqha) is a way for novices to have a bird eye look at the FIFA NFTs released by FIFA+ Collect. A very important factor in designing this dashboard has been given to its business relevance. Each query has been placed and set up in a way to derive insights from the Algorand database provided on [Flipside Velocity](https://app.flipsidecrypto.com/velocity)

# Introduction ðŸš€
FIFA introduced [FIFA+ Collect](https://collect.fifa.com/), which is a platform which allows its fans to purchase digital collectables of some of the most memorable moments in the history of FIFA

# Process âš¡

## EDA ðŸ”Ž
1. The analysis starts off with finding the number of drops and NFTs released in the FIFA NFT collection
2. Then we see the total sales for each drop, the number of purchasers and the number of NFTs for each drop
3. The previous process step will allow a novice in the NFT domain to find which collection is the most popular in terms of volume and purchasers

## Time-Series Analytics âŒš
1. A crucial step in analyzing a particular NFT is its growth (in terms of sales and volume) over time. Charting its growth will allow a newbie to really understand if the NFT is performing well. Hence, a further analysis to chart the previously mentioned variables has been performed.
2. A very important part of how well an NFT is performing is the difference in Mint and Secondary sales. To help the user with this variable, a log scale line chart with total and average sales for Mint and Secondary sales has been developed. For easy access to the time series graphs, the start data, end date and the type of sale can be customized by the end user of the dashboard.
3. We then proceed on to see the sales of NFT categorized by the player name over a period of time. This has been completed with the help of an animated bar chart, provided in Flipside. With the help of this bar chart we can see 3 variables at one time, and the selection of time is upto the end user of this dashboard. 

## Comparative Analytics ðŸ“Š
1. A comparative analysis is then done on the sales count of the NFTs based on the type of world cup (that are Mens World Cup and Womens World Cup) and which years' NFTs were sold the most.

## TopðŸ”Ÿ - A fun and engaging way for the user to find insights about the NFT collection 
1. Three CTEs were created in the query, namely highest_sold, least_sold, first_sold, latest_sold. These views will help to create a customizable experience for the user. The end user can select among the previously mentioned 4 variables and find the answer. As simple as that.
2. The some values such as the total sales amoung in USD, the image, the drop name and many others are displayed to provide more thorough information.
